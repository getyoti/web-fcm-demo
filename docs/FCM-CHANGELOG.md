# CHANGELOG

## v2.2.1

### Notices

- Improved face validations performance, resulting in faster image captures.
- Improved face stability validation. Now it is easier to capture the image.

### Fixes

- Fixed a bug causing undesired triggers of the `onError` callback when
  `userRetryError` was set to `false`.
- A note for `userRetryError` property has been added in [`2.0.1-beta.1`](#v200-beta1) in the breaking changes section.
- `Right-to-left` language localisations now use the proper alignment.
- Fix wrong translation for "Move to the center" message for Portuguese (Brazil).

## v2.2.0

### New features

- New capture mode:

  - Additional `allowBackgroundFaces` configuration property that allows faces
    to be present in the background when the image is being captured. The face
    capture will return a cropped image with the main face when set to `true`.
    Note: This feature is designed for retail terminals and unsuitable for
    online user's face capture.
  - Additional `faceSelectionMethod` configuration property to select where the
    main face can be placed, in the center or anywhere in the image. Note: This
    feature is designed for retail terminals and unsuitable for online user's
    face capture.

  **Note:** It is recommend to enable `allowBackgroundFaces` when `faceSelectionMethod` is set to `area`.

- User feedback added and localized for the new `faceSelectionMethod`.

### Fixes

- Recalibration on the face validations order to improve the user experience
  when capturing the face in challenging light conditions.

## v2.1.0

### New features

- Improve security checks.
- UI improvements on help dialogue.

  `Please try again` to `Please try using a different device`.

### Fixes

- Remove the duplication of `Preparing camera` message when the FCM loads.
- Fix video layout bug on iOS's 17.X version.
- Improve the `scale` feature to fit better the whole container when the FCM is
  scaled.
- Mute Help dialogue video stream.
- Adjust the distribution of icons and text of `Help` to avoid visual bugs
  in certain languages.

#### Peer dependencies updates

## v2.0.0-beta.1

### New features

- The secure mode returns an encrypted image by default now. Use `encryptImage`
  property to return the base64 image in the secure payload. The face capture
  also provides a new property to get the base64 image preview in the `onSuccess`
  callback: `returnPreviewImage`.

- New property to identify your Yoti Hub application: `clientSdkId`.

- Secure module deprecation and end support handling.

  - The Face Capture will log a warning message when the secure module version in use
    becomes deprecated. It will return the error `VERSION_NO_LONGER_AVAILABLE`
    in the `onError` callback when the support has ended.

- New property to allow auto-reload of the secure session before the session expires: `autoSessionReload`.

- New property to let the user handle errors by retrying several times: `userRetryError`. It is enabled by default.

- New design:

  - The Face Capture will show a loading screen when it returns a valid
    image in the `onSuccess` callback or an error screen if it runs the
    `onError` callback.

  - New Guidance screen that will be shown before the webcam loads. It can be hidden by providing the property `showInitialGuidance` with value `false`

  - New Get Help button in the webcam view. It can be hidden by providing the property `showGetHelpButton` with value `false`.

  - New font family (it can still be changed by `--fcm-font-family` css
    variable).

  - Improved manual mode user feedback.

  - Improved Face Capture responsiveness.

  - It is possible to customize some styles by using css variables. These are
    the properties that can be changed:

      primary buttons (Take picture, Try again, ... ).
    - `--fcm-primary-button-background-color-hover` changes the background
      color in primary buttons (Take picture, Try again, ... ) when is hovered.

  - The new property `clientSdkId` is required when using secure mode. So will be required by default.

- The property `buttonSize` was removed.

- The property `isConsentRequired` was removed.

- The properties `CustomManualButton` and `CustomConsentButton` were removed.

- The property `countdownMode` was removed.

- The minimum size for the Face Capture in landscape view is 576px.

- As the `userRetryError` is set to true by default, the `onError` will not be triggered until the user runs out of tries.

#### Peer dependencies updates

- Updated `react` dependency version to be at least `16.14.0` and a maximum of `18.2.0`.

- Updated `react-dom` dependency version to be at least `16.14.0` and a maximum of `18.2.0`.

## v1.4.0

### New features

- Implemented localisation languages:

  - `sk-SK`: Slovak
  - `hu-HU`: Hungarian

- The translations are available for the manual button.

- It is possible to change the default button size. There are three options: SMALL, MEDIUM and LARGE. The new field, `buttonSize`, can be used for changing the button size: `buttonSize={BUTTON_SIZE.SMALL}`.

  > In addition, we can't guarantee external customizations support on new versions of the library

### Notices

- `CustomManualButton` and `CustomConsentButton` are deprecated. They will be removed on 2.0.0 version.

- Use the new Yoti colors for the button and overlay feedback.

## v1.1.0

### New features

- New way to sign the `onSuccess` result in the secure mode.

### Fixes

- `faceCaptureAssetsRootUrl` is no longer typed as a required prop.

## v1.0.0

### New features

- Removed `widthMinConstraint` and `widthIdealConstraint` from the Face Capture Module props.

- Added `resolutionType` prop to provide a semantic and easier way of selecting the desired resolution.
  The possible values for the new prop are:

  - `hd`
  - `full_hd`

- Added `onReadyForCapture` callback to provide a way for the integrators to know when the module is ready to take images.

- Now, the Face Capture Module will stop the process and the camera when the page is hidden.

  - There is a known issue on iPhone Firefox when opening a new FCM instance in a different tab, that may cause the previous one to freeze.

- Now, the vanilla version of the Face Capture Module also exports some useful constants, as the React version does. Here is a list of all of them:

  - **CAPTURE_METHOD**
  - **COUNTDOWN_MODES**
  - **ERROR_CODE**
  - **FORMAT_TYPE**
  - **IMAGE_TYPE**
  - **LANGUAGE_CODE**
  - **QUALITY_TYPE**
  - **RESOLUTION_TYPE**

    New constants can be accessed by using `Yoti.<CONSTANT_NAME>`.

- Now, `countdownMode` has new options:

  - `never` and `always` remains the same.
  - `auto` has been replaced by `only_mobile` and `only_desktop` which brings extra configuration for all possible scenarios.

- Implemented localisation languages:

  - `ur`: Urdu
  - `hy`: Armenian
  - `he`: Hebrew

- Updated localisation languages:

  - `it`: Italian
  - `es-419`: Latin American Spanish

- Fixed typo in German localisation.

- Manual capture method fallback when slow performance, is now optional with the new `manualCaptureFallback` prop.

- Added type declaration file `index.d.ts` for the Face Capture component and exported properties.

- CustomManualButton and CustomConsentButton properties are not supported in the vanilla version.

### Minor changes

- Removed ellipsis from user feedback messages.

### Fixes

- Fix error added on `FCM 1.0.0-beta.2` causing `JPEG` images to be more compressed than desired on landscape scenario.

## v1.0.0-beta.3

Fix a package install error which causes `yarn` and older `npm` versions to fail.

## v1.0.0-beta.2

### New features

- Capture secure mode.
- Vanilla version reload.
- New FCM Design.
- New optional "consent" button.
- Default captureMethod changed from "Manual" to "Auto".

### Breaking changes

Now, the `onSuccess` callback returns the image in the `img` field instead of
`image`.

- Before:

  ```json
  {
    "image": "<base64_img>"
  }
  ```

- After:

  - No secure:

    ```json
    {
      "img": "<base64_img>"
    }
    ```

  - Secure:

    ```json
    {
      "img": "<base64_img>",
      "secure": {
        "version": "<fcm_version>",
        "token": "<session_token>",
        "signature": "<result_signature>"
      }
    }
    ```

Now, the `CustomButton` has been split into `CustomManualButton` and `CustomConsentButton` because
of the implementation of the new consent mode. Each of the properties has the same definitions as
the old `CustomButton`, functions using `onClick` and `disabled` as props that return a button
component.

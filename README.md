# web-fcm-demo

Welcome to the Web FCM Demo. The purpose of this repository is to demo the Face Capture Module npm package integration and use the output image to perform a prediction calling Yoti AI Services.

## Setup

This project needs to have a configuration file in order to work. We only need to pass the configuration values as environment variables. We can follow this approach using a `.env.local` file:

Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the configuration values:

```bash
PEM_FILE_PATH=
SDK_ID=
BASE_URL=
ENDPOINT=
```

- **PEM_FILE_PATH:** path to the `.pem` private key needed to request Yoti Services.
- **SDK_ID:** client SDK ID needed to request Yoti Services.
- **BASE_URL:** base URL for the service to be requested.
- **ENDPOINT:** endpoint for the service to be requested.

Both `PEM_FILE_PATH` and `SDK_ID` secrets are obtained from following the instructions in [this document](https://developers.yoti.com/yoti/getting-started-hub). Specifically, under `Generate API keys` section.

The information required to fill the `BASE_URL` and `ENDPOINT` variables can be found [here](https://developers.yoti.com/yoti-myface/integration-guide).

## Run locally

This demo was designed to be run locally. To get started, follow the below steps in the root directory:

1. Install all the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the server that will manage the request:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

3. Start the client:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Now the client is ready to use. You just need to follow the FCM instructions, take a photo and wait for the response.

## Face Capture module

The `Face Capture` module is a npm package that provides a React component which takes pictures using face detection tools.
The usage of this module can be found in `App.js`. You can find more information about how to install the dependency, the API sections, etc [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getyoti/react-face-capture).

## Yoti NodeJS SDK

The `Yoti NodeJS SDK` package allows to integrate a NodeJS back-end with Yoti apps. The usage of this package to perform predictions to a Yoti app can be found in `server.js` file. For more information about this package, check [this link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yoti).
